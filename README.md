# Image Processing and Deep Learning Pipeline

## Overview
This project sets up a comprehensive pipeline for image processing, data augmentation, and building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras. It leverages powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, and others for various image and data manipulation tasks.

## Features
- **Image Loading and Preprocessing**: Utilities for reading and resizing images using libraries like OpenCV and skimage.
- **Data Augmentation**: Leverages the `imgaug` library for image augmentation, including bounding box manipulations.
- **Model Creation**: Builds a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting and data analysis.
- **Pickle Integration**: Facilitates model or data serialization for reuse.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `os`
- `csv`
- `time`
- `opencv-python` (`cv2`)
- `scikit-image` (`skimage`)
- `imageio`
- `imgaug`
- `Pillow` (`PIL`)
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `IPython`

## Installation
Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python scikit-image imageio imgaug Pillow tensorflow matplotlib seaborn ipython
